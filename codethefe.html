	<p>You've probably been sitting there wondering, <i>"God, why is this happening only to me? Am I the unlucky one?"</i>. We feel you are not alone, about 42% of us have been experiencing a decline in mental health. For the record, earlier this number had been merely 12% before COVID-19.Clearly,lockdown has impacted the human race badly. Even otherwise, Aren't we prone to being sad and lonely for various reasons? </p>
        <br>
        <p>It so happens that an acquaintance or a friend of yours crosses by and asks you a simple question such as <i>"Wassup?"</i> and something like <i>"I'm doing good"</i> comes out of your mouth without you even  realizing how you are actually <i>"enjoying"</i> your life  in the first place. Heck, we don't complain but it's a conventional way of answering to these types of questions. But have you ever thought why you couldn't <i>feel</i> those words when you utter them? This is because, as the famous writer Dan Brown quoted <i>"The human mind has a primitive ego defense mechanism that negates all realities that  produce too much stress for the brain to handle. It's called DENIAL"</i>. So basically, we restrict ourselves from opening up. But this does not end here. Our brains have a <i>"cringe"</i> attitude of rewinding the bitter events, even as old as 10 years  and replaying it a million times and thus making us even more sad about our own lives. Eventually, we are into an existential crisis from which we cannot find a plausible reason to come out from. But don't lose hope, lift up your spirits and keep reading! </p>

        <p><i>Have you ever realized that SAD is the abbreviation for Seasonal Affective Disorder?</i>  Apparently, Life is spontaneous and so is sadness. A feeling of sadness is permeated in your surrounding when you are sad and depressed. This not only affects you but also your beloved ones. Never to forget, it takes a toll on your brain too!!! Yes, you heard us right!!! Low serotonin  and Dopamine levels have been instrumental in making a person feel low. Amygdala, a part of the limbic system, actually detects stress and tells HPA axis( Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal) to respond. This works when hypothalamus activates pituitary gland to release certain hormones that will in turn make adrenal gland to release cortisol which is known as the stress hormone.. Phew!!! yes it's a  bit complicated process that's happening inside you. <i>So, why to get sad in the first place?</i>üòè</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>What tense do you think sadness is associated with?</i> If you ask us, we will say <i>"sadness is present tense"</i>. Now, you may ask us back <i>"I was expecting to achieve 'this' goal some 5 years back but I couldn't due to various reasons and this is something that happened 5 years ago and obviously as it appears 'this' sadness is associated with past tense"</i>. So, now what if we ask you <i>" Don't you feel low now thinking about an incident that happened years ago in spite of devoting your heart and soul to it?"</i> . Though it apparently looks like you have <i>"moved on"</i> but actually you have <i>"moved forward with it"</i>. So, how do you think <i>"moving forward with it"</i> happens in our lives? If you are familiar with <i>"buffering"</i>, you almost got the answer. For those who aren't aware, here's a bit of an explanation on <i>"Social Buffering"</i>. It is the process that occurs when social support helps the brain regulate the stress response. In simple words, it means to protect or shield and this happens through <i>"love and presence"</i> of our caregivers. Research has shown that caregivers help to lower cortisol levels in people who are stressed. So, we suggest you to interact with people lightheartedly and if you feel its near to impossible, you can grow a plant or raise a pet and talk to it whenever you feel low. Adding on, you can even start meditating or if possible try to keep yourself engaged by incorporating  a new hobby such as singing, dancing, jogging, cycling, reading, playing instruments and what not!. In this way you are not only keeping yourself away from sadness externally but also trying your best to heal your brain by enabling more secretion of serotonin and dopamine. Above all, never forget to love yourself and thank every moment of your life because self-love is the best thing that you can gift yourself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And here comes the take-home message, <i>sadness is not a moment, but it's a multi-tasking emotion.</i> You can be happy and sad at the same time. It goes hand-in-hand.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, <i>Don't you think you can overcome sadness and find love again?</i></p>
